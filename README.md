# Pipeline Metrics Exporter MVP

Pipeline Metrics Exporter is Utility #29 of the RADAR_SERVICE
Runtime Observability Phase.

It converts observability report artifacts into portable formats for
analysis, sharing, dashboards, audits, and operational documentation.

## Purpose

Previous utilities generate structured JSON artifacts:

- Utility #26 — Pipeline Metrics Collector
- Utility #27 — Pipeline Health Analyzer
- Utility #28 — Pipeline Health Trend Analyzer

Utility #29 answers:

> How can these observability artifacts be exported into formats that
> people, spreadsheets, dashboards, and external tools can consume?

## Planned input artifacts

- Metrics reports
- Health reports
- Trend reports

## Planned export formats

- CSV
- Markdown
- HTML
- Excel

Excel support remains part of the Utility #29 roadmap and is not yet
implemented at M1.

## Planned capabilities

- Detect supported observability report types
- Load JSON report artifacts
- Normalize report metadata and tabular sections
- Export metrics into CSV
- Export summaries into Markdown
- Export reports into standalone HTML
- Export workbook artifacts
- Validate generated exports
- Inspect export manifests
- Provide an automation-friendly CLI
- Generate a JSON export report

Small enhancements may be inserted as `M8.1`, `M8.2`, and later
sub-milestones when needed without restructuring the complete roadmap.
